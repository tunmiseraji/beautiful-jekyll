My name is Tunmise Raji and I am interested in energy project development in the Global South. I believe renewable energy systems have a key role to play in reducing the energy poverty in Africa and for the last 2 years, I have been focused on gaining espertise in the technological and commercial aspects of these systems. I am currently an electrical design engineer at [Equatorial Power](http://equatorial-power.com) where I perform demand analysis and systems sizing of the company's mini-grids.
